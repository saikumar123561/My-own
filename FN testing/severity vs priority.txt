severity vs priority
===================

when we raise any defecrt in JIRA tool we need to give severity and priority

severity  -->  if the defect is impacting the customer or app workflow

priority   -->  how soon we want dev to fix the defect  (imp of defect)   or   urgency of fixing the defects


Type of severity:
==============

Blocker  -->  ur trying to login into the app but ur getting blank page or interanal server error

critical  -->  if the main / basic fn of the app is not working. customer bussniness workflow is completely broken.

major   -->   like when we are buying the product, the amt got paid but i am not getting any confirmation through message, email

minor   -->  look and feel of the app, spelling mistakes, alignment issues



Types of priority
================

Highest    -->    which dev has to fix it immediately

high  -->  dev has to fix in the comming builds

low    -->    dev has to fix in the comming releases

lowest    



high severity and high priority : ur trying to login into the app but ur getting blank page or internal server error   or login button is missing     -->  immediaetely

high severity and low priority : suppose there is link called "About us" but it is taking to blank page. since it is not impacting the customer workflow and customer not frequently visists the page.    -->   upcoming builds

high priority and low severity : lets say in our app login page there is spelling mistake in username and customer frequently visits the page.  or app log     -->  immediaetely

low severity and low priority : suppose there is link called "Contact us" when customer click it, the field "email id" having a spelling mistake.  since it is not impacting the customer workflow. and also the customer won't visit the page most often.

Font issues, alignment issues


severity given by QA or BA
priority decided by Dev

Q) defect severity vs defect priority?

severity
==========
Bussiness impact, legal impact, financial impact, no of users impact, impact on brand

Critical severity: if the defect is impacting many users.
legal impact, No work around, impacting the transactions

High severity: 


Low severity: Font issues, alignment issues, no users impacted



Priority: urgency of fixing the defects

dev have daily bug triage meetings

-->  technical impact, dependencies, order of fixing the defects, time required to fix, how much time we have to release the code

dependencies   -->    if D3 is fixed then only we can fix D2, fixing D3 is very imp because 90% test execution is block, fixing D5 is evening we have customer review



severity given by QA or BA
priority decided by Dev

ex: high severity and high priority

blank screen
technical error page cannot be displayed
key fn is missing or major failure


low severity and low priority

spelling mistake, the field should dislay should display right hand side instead of dispalying center, format issues (alignment issues)


High severity and low priority :  there is no urgency to fix the defect but the impact is very high. it won't impact the fn of the app| flow of the app

High priority and low severity
