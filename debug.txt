i have libraires, utilities .....

understanding the flow of the framework
through debugging i am checking each and every step how exactly it is working to get the confidence




to identify where is the bug    -->  we need to do debugging to fix the bug

approach   -->  bruteforce method


debug:
========

breakpoint   -->  double click (one dot will be created that is called debugging point, the moment we execute the program it will stop where put the debug point)

in debugging mode we solve the script issues and internal depth of the code

how to get into debugging mode   -->  open perspective   -->  debug   -->   15:30
debug as   -->  testng

we have 4 debugging options are available 
f6  -->  if u want to execute line no x
f8  -->  move to next debug   (resume)
f5  -->  step into   (enters inside the method)    for user defined methods u can use f5 not for custom fn
f7  -->

at run time we can check the expressions, statements values, variable values


Assert.assertTrue(home.enterUsername());
