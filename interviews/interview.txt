Q) how will u achieve encapsulation in automation framework?

in Base class we declared all variables as private to available the variables to all the classes we implemented Getters


Q) how will u declare globall variables in automation framework?

A) By using properties class (java) this class can access the content inside the .properties extension file

basically this properties files maintain in the form of key and value
then we need to tell where exactly this file is present by using FIP
then load the file using load();
to extract the value just we need to use getProperty();
to update the data just we need to use setProperty();



Q) how do u deal with reusable componenets in automation framework?

A) by using extends keyword we can achieve this. we have one BaseTest class where we perform all reusable methods | components to use those reusable components in our actual TC by inheriting them.


Q) how to run automation framework from jenkins?
we can run our automation framework with the help of mvn cmd's 

A) our automation framework should be available in maven project, inside the pom.xml file we need to configure the testng.xml file.
this framework should be checkin into the any branch in the git

we need to create one job by clicking on new item
in SCM section we need to provide the repo url where our framework code resides
in build section we need to pass the mvn goals
we can schedule our jobs triggers in build trigger section like pollscm, build periodically with the help of cron

Q) how do we arrange the locators in automation framework?             -->   22 question rahul shetty

A) POM  (we seggregate the locators available in each page in separate java class) and write corresponding methods to interact 

test cases are maintain in diff java class where we call the methods specific to that locator

in case any locator needs to be updated | deleted we need to modify them in particular java class for that specific screen not everywhere

easy to use and maintain
