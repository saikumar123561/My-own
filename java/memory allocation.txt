Memory allocation
====================

Heap memory is used for storage 
Stack memory is used for execution	



Stack
==========
stores methods (local variables) 
LIFO mechanism
(here memory allocation is taken care by JVM) when method is called it is allocated and when method return it is deallocated
ref variables  are created here and it points to Objects


Heap
===========
it stores newly created Objects   
eden space, survivor 1, survivor 2, garbage collector will move the objects to survivor 1, survivor 2 once eden space got full
(here memory allocation is taken care by garbage collector. it will destroy the objects that doesn't have ref)


permanent generation | after jdk 1.8 metaspace 
============================================
stores static variables and static methods

for permanent generation size was fixed| after jdk 1.8 metaspace it can increase the size based on requirement
