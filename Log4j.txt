what is log?
capturing info/activities at the time of program execution.

types/level of logs: info, warn, debug, fatal

how to generate logs?    -->   using Apache log4j api
how it works?    -->   it reads log4j configuration from log4j.properties/log4j.xml file 

we don't need to go to remote machine and check logs everytime. we can monitor the logs directly from local system also.

we can identify the failures/exceptions at run time


Log4j
==========

-->  download log4j dependencies/jars

-->  place Log4j.properties (or) Log4j.xml in project home dir

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
-->  Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("classname");                
       DOMConfigurator.configure("Log4j.xml");                                         -->  if u use Log4j.xml

-->  Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("class");
       PropertyConfigurator.configure("Log4j.properties");                                           -->  if u use Log4j.properties


logger.info("browser is opened");                         -->   for every line we write comment in the sameway this logger also works
driver.get("url");

logger.info("clicked on login button");
login.click();

so whatever messages we are passing will be logged into logfile at the backend

so when we execute the program it creates the log folder in our project
-->  if we use Log4j.xml   ---    it creates a text file "logfile.log"
-->  if we use Log4j.properties   --    it creates a folder "Log" -- creates 3 files inside Log folder
