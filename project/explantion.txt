Project explanation:
=====================

client side : HTML5, CSS, javascript
server side: Linux, apache, mysql, php

HTML5   -->  is a language used to define the structure of web page
CSS  -->  is a language used to style the web page by using diff styling features
javascript   -->  gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user



I worked on healthcare Domain. It is a web application developed using LAMP (Linux, HTML, CSS, and MySQL) technology…
Through this provider integrated platform which helps in collobarating with the patient to provide complete treatment and overall well being. 

overhere the patient can schedule an appointment online. provider can see the list of patients, details of paitent visits, health history, clinical documents, patient health condition, current medication, prescription, advice for visit  and other services, patient can claim his insurance policy, 
And it has 3 major Interfaces admin, provider, patient, receptionist and Database Interface also…

most of the cases these are manual, like enter the details in word/excel document as a result client had to maintain a huge volume like patient documents, missing documents, patient medical records
departments for approvals which results in patient dissatisfaction

Admin Interface for maintaining the application (ex: Add/Edit/Delete services, provider details, patient details, managing drugs)

patient Interface for performing specified business operations (ex: in my Application, patient Registration, Login to Application, make appointment, consult doctor etc..are important business operations…

provider Interface for editing doctor details, appointment details with a patient health history.

receptionist Interface to confirm appointment

Database interface is to store the data, and processing the data.

i have involved in testing admin module and patient module aswell

Admin Module- in this module important functionalities are,  doctor services, medical services, managing drugs, patient details, doctor details and other services

Patient Module- in this module important functionalities are, Patient registration, Login to Application Patient Interface,
Make an appointment, Consult doctor


tools and technologies we implemented as part of testing are selenium webdriver with java for automation, writing the TC in testng and implementing POM desing with Data Driven framework. for SCM we are using Git, build tool we are using Maven and for CI/CD we are using jenkins. and we are following agile methadology

in this the project i majorly involved into automation activities where i am taking part in development of scripts, developement of framework where we build utilities, execution of the script via jenkins and finally maintainence.

Project Architecture:
=====================

we are using client and server architecture where we are implementing 3 tier. so the app is virtually split into three separate logical layers. such as presentation layer, application layer, data access layer.

presentation layer where we see the UI and application layer where bussiness logic will be written and data access layer where the data stored.

internally it work like First, Client send a request through browser, business logic happens at second layer, it executes the request. Based on your request, corresponding business logic is triggered. And, then it will pass the request to database server which processes the data. And again it will sent back to Business layer and passed on to Client layer. And henceforth, you see response on your browser. 

the  technologies we used to design this 3 tier architecture

For Presentation Layer – we used scripting languages HTML5, JavaScript and CSS

For Business Layer –  we used java programming languages to code.

For Data access Layer – we used MySQL

features:   -->   https://www.softermii.com/blog/20-must-have-healthcare-app-features-with-examples
https://solutiondots.com/blog/9-modules-hospital-management-system-developed-solutiondots-systems/
================    

Online appointment feature  -->  where patient can make an appointment with doctor at their available slots and ge the confirmation via sms or email

An e-Prescription Feature 
EHR (electronic health record) software  enable us to record and store medical records on a remote or cloud-hosted server.

Project related questions
=====================

Q) what UI framework using?
angular as a ui framework and we are using browser cache for cahce purpose

Q) how to validate whether the user is authenticated or not?
we are using ldap for the authentication. But, I never get a chance to work on the ldap. so, i don't have exact idea how ldap works. 

lightweight directory access protocol, it is very very light weight and so much secure. it runs over the tcp and ip protocol

Q) how cache was configured
by the time i join the project the project was already setup so i was not completely aware how the cache was configured


coming to the back end services we have used rest api to expose our api's 

db -->  mysql and we are using jdbc to connect to the db


Q) why is ur project design in that way?
by the time i joined the project was already designed

Q) what design patterns u followed and y?
singleton design pattern/ factory design pattern / abstract factory design pattern

Q) what was the most complicated part of our project?
us healthcare terminology and it's usages


Q) how have u handled cache?


Q) how do u connect to db?
jdbc / hibernet there are n no of technologies


Q) why u are using jdbc 
we have a senior architecture who decides what technologies to be used.
as a service based we have to follow the client  we have taken up input he suggested to go with hybernet

Q) who are user end users of ur project?
patient, providers


Q) how do u validate a user is authorized to access a particular page of fn?


Q) why have u used selenium only? what benifit?
we had a decision from the client architect

we can add easily 


Q) do u participate in project design?
i attend the project design meetings and sit with my seniors i just listen and i provide input to my senior not directly on the call.


into, adv, features availabe
diff modules and which module u involved
tools and tech to implement the project
responsibilities in the project  -->  should be short



how long it took time to complete the project
