tests with lower priority value gets first ref


Upper case will take the first priority based on aasic value

if all tests have same priority value, then the tests will get execute in alphabetic order

if one test has priority value other than 0 and other tests do not have priority value, then testng assigns zero priority to those tests which do not have priority value and tests get executed with 0 priority in alphabetic order and atlast test with some priority gets executed. 

can we have tests with -ve priority   -->   yes  -->  negative will execute first

-45, -67, -1, 0, 2, 1  -->     -67, -45, -1, 0, 1, 2

can we have tests with decimal     -->    yes   -->  but it should be type cast with "int"

@Test(priority = (int) 4.5)

can u prove StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer with sample program













java consider sum of 2 bytes is an int

setclasspath=path tio bin folder of your project;path to lib folder where testng related jar files are located

set classpath = C:\Users\user\Desktop\february\feb\saisolutions\bin;C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Pictures\Selenium\eclipse-jee-oxygen-R-win32-x86_64\eclipse\plugins\*

 Now run testing.xml file using Java org.testng.TestNG "testngmxlfilename.xml"
