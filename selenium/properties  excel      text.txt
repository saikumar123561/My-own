properties files   -->  17 April first  -  17 april Second    (2 classes)





Q) how u implemented properties files?

A) basically the data in properties files maintained in the form of keys and values 

in order to work with properties files we have properties class which is coming from java.util package   -->  
"FileInputStream" to specify the path of the file which is coming from "java.io package"

Properties class  -->  

getProperty()  -->  to get the values based on key from properties files

getProperty(String key, defaultvalue)

setProperty()  -->  we can write the data in the form of keys and values to the properties files

get()   -->  map interface

getOrDefault()    -->  map interface

put()   -->  map interface
